<h3 id="111-about-the-freertos-kernel"><a class="header" href="#111-about-the-freertos-kernel">1.1.1 About the FreeRTOS Kernel</a></h3>
<p>FreeRTOS is a collection of C libraries comprised of a real-time kernel
and a set of modular libraries that implement complementary
functionality.</p>
<p>Richard Barry originally developed FreeRTOS around 2003. Real-Time
Engineers Ltd, Richard's company, continued FreeRTOS development in
close partnership with the world's leading chip companies until Amazon
Web Services (AWS) took stewardship of FreeRTOS 2016. Richard now
continues his work on FreeRTOS as a senior principal engineer within the
AWS IoT team.  FreeRTOS is MIT licensed open source code, available for
any purpose.  You don't have to be an AWS customer to benefit from AWS's
stewardship!</p>
<p>The FreeRTOS kernel is ideally suited to deeply embedded real-time
applications that run on microcontrollers or small microprocessors. This
type of application typically includes a mix of both hard and soft
real-time requirements.</p>
<p>Soft real-time requirements state a time deadline—but breaching the
deadline would not render the system useless. For example, responding to
keystrokes too slowly might make a system seem annoyingly unresponsive
without actually making it unusable.</p>
<p>Hard real-time requirements state a time deadline—and breaching the
deadline would result in absolute failure of the system. For example, a
driver's airbag has the potential to do more harm than good if it
responded to crash sensor inputs too slowly.</p>
<p>The FreeRTOS kernel is a real-time kernel (or real-time scheduler) that
enables applications built on FreeRTOS to meet their hard real-time
requirements. It enables applications to be organized as a collection of
independent threads of execution. For example, on a processor that has
only one core, only a single thread of execution can execute at any
one time. The kernel decides which thread to execute by examining the
priority assigned to each thread by the application designer. In the
simplest case, the application designer could assign higher priorities
to threads that implement hard real-time requirements and lower
priorities to threads that implement soft real-time requirements.
Allocating priorities in that way would ensure hard real-time threads
always execute ahead of soft real-time threads, but priority assignment
decisions are not always that simplistic.</p>
<p>Do not be concerned if you do not fully understand the concepts in the
previous paragraph yet. The following chapters provide a detailed
explanation, with many examples, to help you understand how to use a
real-time kernel, and FreeRTOS in particular.</p>
<h3 id="112-value-proposition"><a class="header" href="#112-value-proposition">1.1.2 Value Proposition</a></h3>
<p>The unprecedented global success of the FreeRTOS kernel comes from its
compelling value proposition; FreeRTOS is professionally developed,
strictly quality controlled, robust, supported, does not contain any
intellectual property ownership ambiguity, and is truly free to use in
commercial applications without any requirement to expose your
proprietary source code. Further, AWS's stewardship provides a global
presence, expert security event response procedures, a large and diverse
development team, expertise in formal verification, pen testing, memory
safety proofs, and long-term
support – all while maintaining FreeRTOS as a hardware, development
tool, and cloud service-neutral open-source project. FreeRTOS
development is transparent and community-driven in GitHub, and does not
require any special tools or development practices.</p>
<p>You can take a product to market using FreeRTOS without even telling us,
let alone paying any fees, and thousands of companies do just that. If
at any time you would like to receive additional backup, or if your
legal team requires additional written guarantees or indemnification,
then our strategic partners provide simple low-cost commercial license
options. Peace of mind comes with the knowledge that you can opt to take
the commercial route whenever you choose.</p>
<h3 id="113-a-note-about-terminology"><a class="header" href="#113-a-note-about-terminology">1.1.3 A Note About Terminology</a></h3>
<p>In FreeRTOS, each thread of execution is called a 'task'. There is no
consensus on terminology within the embedded community, but I prefer
'task' to 'thread,' as thread can have a more specific meaning in some
fields of application.</p>
<h3 id="114-why-use-an-rtos"><a class="header" href="#114-why-use-an-rtos">1.1.4 Why Use an RTOS?</a></h3>
<p>There are many well-established techniques for writing good embedded
software without using a multithreading kernel. If the system under
development is simple, then these techniques might provide the most
appropriate solution. Using a kernel would likely be preferable in more
complex cases, but where the crossover point occurs will always be
subjective.</p>
<p>As already described, task prioritization can help ensure an application
meets its processing deadlines, but a kernel can bring other less
obvious benefits. Some of these are listed very briefly below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Abstracting away timing information</p>
<p>The RTOS is responsible for execution timing and provides a time-related
API to the application. That allows the structure of the application
code to be more straightforward and the overall code size to be smaller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintainability/Extensibility</p>
<p>Abstracting away timing details results in fewer interdependencies
between modules and allows the software to evolve in a controlled and
predictable way. Also, the kernel is responsible for the timing, so
application performance is less susceptible to changes in the underlying
hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modularity</p>
<p>Tasks are independent modules, each of which should have a well-defined
purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team development</p>
<p>Tasks should also have well-defined interfaces, allowing easier
team development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easier testing</p>
<p>Tasks that are well-defined independent modules with clean interfaces
are easier to test in isolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code reuse</p>
<p>Code designed with greater modularity and fewer interdependencies is
easier to reuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved efficiency</p>
<p>Application code that uses an RTOS can be completely event-driven. No
processing time needs to be wasted by polling for events that
have not occurred.</p>
<p>Countering the efficiency gained from being event driven is the need to process the RTOS tick
interrupt and switch execution from one task to another. However,
applications that don't use an RTOS normally include some form of tick
interrupt anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idle time</p>
<p>The automatically created Idle task executes when there are no
application tasks that require processing. The Idle task can measure
spare processing capacity, perform background checks, or place the
processor into a low-power mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Power Management</p>
<p>The efficiency gains that result from using an RTOS allow the processor to
spend more time in a low power mode.</p>
<p>Power consumption can be decreased significantly by placing the
processor into a low power state each time the Idle task runs. FreeRTOS
also has a special tick-less mode. Using the tick-less mode allows the
processor to enter a lower power mode than would otherwise be possible
and remain in the low power mode for longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexible interrupt handling</p>
<p>Interrupt handlers can be kept very short by deferring processing to
either a task created by the application writer or the automatically
created RTOS daemon task (also known as the timer task).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mixed processing requirements</p>
<p>Simple design patterns can achieve a mix of periodic, continuous, and
event-driven processing within an application. In addition, hard and
soft real-time requirements can be met by selecting appropriate task and
interrupt priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
