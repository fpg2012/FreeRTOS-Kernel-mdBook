<h2 id="101-introduction"><a class="header" href="#101-introduction">10.1 Introduction</a></h2>
<p>FreeRTOS applications are typically structured as a series of independent tasks that communicate with each other to collectively provide the system functionality.  Task notifications are an efficient mechanism allowing one task to directly notify another task.</p>
<h3 id="1011-communicating-through-intermediary-objects"><a class="header" href="#1011-communicating-through-intermediary-objects">10.1.1 Communicating Through Intermediary Objects</a></h3>
<p>This book has already described various ways in which tasks can
communicate with each other. The methods described so far have required
the creation of a communication object. Examples of communication
objects include queues, event groups, and various different types of
semaphore.</p>
<p>When a communication object is used, events and data are not sent
directly to a receiving task, or a receiving ISR, but are instead sent
to the communication object. Likewise, tasks and ISRs receive events and
data from the communication object, rather than directly from the task
or ISR that sent the event or data. This is depicted in Figure 10.1.</p>
<p><a name="fig10.1" title="Figure 10.1 A communication object being used to send an event from one task to another"></a></p>

<h3 id="1012-task-notificationsdirect-to-task-communication"><a class="header" href="#1012-task-notificationsdirect-to-task-communication">10.1.2 Task Notificationsâ€”Direct to Task Communication</a></h3>
<p>'Task Notifications' allow tasks to interact with other tasks, and to
synchronize with ISRs, without the need for a separate communication
object. By using a task notification, a task or ISR can send an event
directly to the receiving task. This is depicted in Figure 10.2.</p>
<p><a name="fig10.2" title="Figure 10.2 A task notification used to send an event directly from one task to another"></a></p>

<em><strong>Figure 10.2</strong></em> <em>A task notification used to send an event directly from one task to another</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Task notification functionality is optional. To include task
notification functionality set <code>configUSE_TASK_NOTIFICATIONS</code> to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.</p>
<p>When <code>configUSE_TASK_NOTIFICATIONS</code> is set to 1, each task has at least one
'Notification State', which can be either 'Pending' or 'Not-Pending',
and a 'Notification Value', which is a 32-bit unsigned integer. When a
task receives a notification, its notification state is set to pending.
When a task reads its notification value, its notification state is set
to not-pending.  If the <code>configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES</code> is set to a value
&gt; 1 then there are multiple Notification states and values identified by index.</p>
<p>A task can wait in the Blocked state, with an optional time out, for its
notification state to become pending.</p>

<h3 id="1021-performance-benefits-of-task-notifications"><a class="header" href="#1021-performance-benefits-of-task-notifications">10.2.1 Performance Benefits of Task Notifications</a></h3>
<p>Using a task notification to send an event or data to a task is
significantly faster than using a queue, semaphore or event group to
perform an equivalent operation.</p>
<h3 id="1022-ram-footprint-benefits-of-task-notifications"><a class="header" href="#1022-ram-footprint-benefits-of-task-notifications">10.2.2 RAM Footprint Benefits of Task Notifications</a></h3>
<p>Likewise, using a task notification to send an event or data to a task
requires significantly less RAM than using a queue, semaphore or event
group to perform an equivalent operation. This is because each
communication object (queue, semaphore or event group) must be created
before it can be used, whereas enabling task notification functionality
has a fixed overhead.  The RAM cost for task notifications is
<code>configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES</code> * 5 bytes per task.  The
default value for <code>configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES</code> is 1 making
the default size for task notifications is 5 bytes per task.</p>
<h3 id="1023-limitations-of-task-notifications"><a class="header" href="#1023-limitations-of-task-notifications">10.2.3 Limitations of Task Notifications</a></h3>
<p>Task notifications are faster and use less RAM than communication
objects, but task notifications cannot be used in all scenarios. This
section documents the scenarios in which a task notification cannot be
used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sending an event or data to an ISR</p>
<p>Communication objects can be used to send events and data from an ISR
to a task, and from a task to an ISR.</p>
<p>Task notifications can be used to send events and data from an ISR to
a task, but they cannot be used to send events or data from a task to
an ISR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enabling more than one receiving task</p>
<p>A communication object can be accessed by any task or ISR that knows
its handle (which might be a queue handle, semaphore handle, or event
group handle). Any number of tasks and ISRs can process events or data
sent to any given communication object.</p>
<p>Task notifications are sent directly to the receiving task, so they can
only be processed by the task to which the notification is sent.
However, this is rarely a limitation in practical cases because, while
it is common to have multiple tasks and ISRs sending to the same
communication object, it is rare to have multiple tasks and ISRs
receiving from the same communication object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buffering multiple data items</p>
<p>A queue is a communication object that can hold more than one data
item at a time. Data that has been sent to the queue, but not yet
received from the queue, is buffered inside the queue object.</p>
<p>Task notifications send data to a task by updating the receiving
task's notification value. A task's notification value can only hold
one value at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broadcasting to more than one task</p>
<p>An event group is a communication object that can be used to send an
event to more than one task at a time.</p>
<p>Task notifications are sent directly to the receiving task, so can
only be processed by the receiving task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waiting in the blocked state for a send to complete</p>
<p>If a communication object is temporarily in a state that means no more
data or events can be written to it (for example, when a queue is full
no more data can be sent to the queue), then tasks attempting to write
to the object can optionally enter the Blocked state to wait for their
write operation to complete.</p>
<p>If a task attempts to send a task notification to a task that already
has a notification pending, then it is not possible for the sending
task to wait in the Blocked state for the receiving task to reset its
notification state. As will be seen, this is rarely a limitation in
practical cases in which a task notification is used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="103-using-task-notifications"><a class="header" href="#103-using-task-notifications">10.3 Using Task Notifications</a></h2>
<h3 id="1031-task-notification-api-options"><a class="header" href="#1031-task-notification-api-options">10.3.1 Task Notification API Options</a></h3>
<p>Task notifications are a very powerful feature that can often be used in
place of a binary semaphore, a counting semaphore, an event group, and
sometimes even a queue. This wide range of usage scenarios can be
achieved by using the <code>xTaskNotify()</code> API function to send a task
notification, and the <code>xTaskNotifyWait()</code> API function to receive a task
notification.</p>
<p>However, in the majority of cases, the full flexibility provided by the
<code>xTaskNotify()</code> and <code>xTaskNotifyWait()</code> API functions is not required, and
simpler functions would suffice. Therefore, the <code>xTaskNotifyGive()</code> API
function is provided as a simpler but less flexible alternative to
<code>xTaskNotify()</code>, and the <code>ulTaskNotifyTake()</code> API function is provided as a
simpler but less flexible alternative to <code>xTaskNotifyWait()</code>.</p>
<p>The task notification system is not limited to a single notification event.  The
configuration parameter <code>configTASK_NOTIFICATION_ARRAY_ENTRIES</code> is set to 1 by default.
If it is set to a value greater than 1, an array of notifications are created inside
each task.  This allows notifications to be managed by index.  Every task
notification api function has an indexed version.  Using the non-indexed version
will result in accessing notification[0] (the first one in the array).  The <code>indexed</code>
version of each API function is identified by the suffix <code>Indexed</code> so the function
<code>xTaskNotify</code> becomes <code>xTaskNotifyIndexed</code>.  For simplicity only the non-indexed
versions of each function will be used throughout this book.</p>
<p>The task notification API's are implemented as macro that make calls to the
underlying <code>Generic</code> versions of each API function type.  For simplicy the API
macros will be called functions throughout this book.</p>

<p><code>xTaskNotifyGive()</code> sends a notification directly to a task, and

Blocked state, and the unblocked task has a priority higher than the
priority of the currently executing task (the task that was
interrupted), then, internally, <code>vTaskNotifyGiveFromISR()</code> will set
<code>*pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken</code> to <code>pdTRUE</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>vTaskNotifyGiveFromISR()</code> sets this value to <code>pdTRUE</code>, then a context
switch should be performed before the interrupt is exited. This will
ensure that the interrupt returns directly to the highest priority Ready

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>xClearCountOnExit</code></p>
<p>If <code>xClearCountOnExit</code> is set to <code>pdTRUE</code>, then the calling task's
notification value will be cleared to zero before the call to
<code>ulTaskNotifyTake()</code> returns.</p>
<p>If <code>xClearCountOnExit</code> is set to <code>pdFALSE</code>, and the calling task's
notification value is greater than zero, then the calling task's
notification value will be decremented before the call to
<code>ulTaskNotifyTake()</code> returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>xTicksToWait</code></p>
<p>The maximum amount of time the calling task should remain in the
Blocked state to wait for its notification value to be greater than
zero.</p>
<p>The block time is specified in tick periods, so the absolute time it
represents is dependent on the tick frequency. The macro <code>pdMS_TO_TICKS()</code>
can be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds to a time
specified in ticks.</p>
<p>Setting <code>xTicksToWait</code> to <code>portMAX_DELAY</code> will cause the task to wait
indefinitely (without timing out), provided <code>INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend</code> is set
to 1 in <code>FreeRTOSConfig.h</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return value</p>
<p>The returned value is the calling task's notification value
<em>before</em> it was either cleared to zero or decremented, as
specified by the value of the <code>xClearCountOnExit</code> parameter.</p>
<p>If a block time was specified (<code>xTicksToWait</code> was not zero), and the
return value is not zero, then it is possible the calling task was
placed into the Blocked state to wait for its notification value to be
greater than zero, and its notification value was updated before the
block time expired.</p>
<p>If a block time was specified (<code>xTicksToWait</code> was not zero), and the
return value is zero, then the calling task was placed into the Blocked
state to wait for its notification value to be greater than zero, but
the specified block time expired before that happened.</p>

<p><em><strong>Example 10.1</strong></em> <em>Using a task notification in place of a semaphore, method 1</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Example 7.1 used a binary semaphore to unblock a task from within an
interrupt service routineâ€”effectively synchronizing the task with the
interrupt. This example replicates the functionality of Example 7.1, but
uses a direct to task notification in place of the binary semaphore.</p>
<p>Listing 10.4 shows the implementation of the task that is synchronized
with the interrupt. The call to <code>xSemaphoreTake()</code> that was used in
Example 7.1 has been replaced by a call to <code>ulTaskNotifyTake()</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>ulTaskNotifyTake()</code> <code>xClearCountOnExit</code> parameter is set to <code>pdTRUE</code>,
which results in the receiving task's notification value being cleared
to zero before <code>ulTaskNotifyTake()</code> returns. It is therefore necessary to
process all the events that are already available between each call to
<code>ulTaskNotifyTake()</code>. In Example 7.1, because a binary semaphore was used,
the number of pending events had to be determined from the hardware,
which is not always practical. In Example 10.1, the number of pending
events is returned from <code>ulTaskNotifyTake()</code>.</p>
<p>Interrupt events that occur between calls to <code>ulTaskNotifyTake</code> are
latched in the task's notification value, and calls to
<code>ulTaskNotifyTake()</code> will return immediately if the calling task already
has notifications pending.</p>

<p><em><strong>Example 10.2</strong></em> <em>Using a task notification in place of a semaphore, method 2</em></p>
<hr />
<p>In Example 10.1, the <code>ulTaskNotifyTake()</code> <code>xClearOnExit</code> parameter was set to
<code>pdTRUE</code>. Example 10.1 modifies Example 10.1 slightly to demonstrate the
behavior when the <code>ulTaskNotifyTake()</code> <code>xClearOnExit</code> parameter is instead
set to <code>pdFALSE</code>.</p>
<p>When <code>xClearOnExit</code> is <code>pdFALSE</code>, calling <code>ulTaskNotifyTake()</code> will only
decrement (reduce by one) the calling task's notification value, instead
of clearing it to zero. The notification count is therefore the
difference between the number of events that have occurred, and the
number of events that have been processed. That allows the structure of
<code>vHandlerTask()</code> to be simplified in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The number of events waiting to be processed is held in the
notification value, so it does not need to be held in a local
variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is only necessary to process one event between each call to

<p>Peripheral driver libraries provide functions that perform common
operations on hardware interfaces. Examples of peripherals for which
such libraries are often provided include Universal Asynchronous
Receivers and Transmitters (UARTs), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
ports, analog to digital converters (ADCs), and Ethernet ports. Examples
of functions typically provided by such libraries include functions to
initialize a peripheral, send data to a peripheral, and receive data
from a peripheral.</p>
<p>Some operations on peripherals take a relatively long time to complete.
Examples of such operations include a high precision ADC conversion, and
the transmission of a large data packet on a UART. In these cases the
driver library function could be implemented to poll (repeatedly read)
the peripheral's status registers to determine when the operation has
completed. However, polling in this manner is nearly always wasteful as
it utilizes 100% of the processor's time while no productive processing
is being performed. The waste is particularly expensive in a
multi-tasking system, where a task that is polling a peripheral might be
preventing the execution of a lower priority task that does have
productive processing to perform.</p>
<p>To avoid the potential for wasted processing time, an efficient RTOS
aware device driver should be interrupt driven, and give a task that
initiates a lengthy operation the option of waiting in the Blocked state
for the operation to complete. That way, lower priority tasks can
execute while the task performing the lengthy operation is in the
Blocked state, and no tasks use processing time unless they can use it
productively.</p>
<p>It is common practice for RTOS aware driver libraries to use a binary
semaphore to place tasks into the Blocked state. The technique is
demonstrated by the pseudo code shown in Listing 10.10, which provides the
outline of an RTOS aware library function that transmits data on a UART
port. In Listing 10.10:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>xUART</code> is a structure that describes the UART peripheral, and holds
state information. The <code>xTxSemaphore</code> member of the structure is a
variable of type <code>SemaphoreHandle_t</code>. It is assumed the semaphore has
already been created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>xUART_Send()</code> function does not include any mutual exclusion
logic. If more than one task is going to use the <code>xUART_Send()</code>
function, then the application writer will have to manage mutual
exclusion within the application itself. For example, a task may be
required to obtain a mutex before calling <code>xUART_Send()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>xSemaphoreTake()</code> API function is used to place the calling task
into the Blocked state after the UART transmission has been initiated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()</code> API function is used to remove the task
from the Blocked state after the transmission has completed, which
is when the UART peripheral's transmit end interrupt service routine
executes.</p>
</li>

<p><em><strong>Listing 10.10</strong></em> <em>Pseudo code demonstrating how a binary semaphore can be used in a driver library transmit function</em></p>
<p>The technique demonstrated in Listing 10.10 is perfectly workable, and
indeed common practice, but it has some drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The library uses multiple semaphores, which increases its RAM
footprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semaphores cannot be used until they have been created, so a library
that uses semaphores cannot be used until it has been explicitly
initialized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semaphores are generic objects that are applicable to a wide range
of use cases; they include logic to allow any number of tasks to
wait in the Blocked state for the semaphore to become available, and
to select (in a deterministic manner) which task to remove from the
Blocked state when the semaphore does become available. Executing
that logic takes a finite time, and that processing overhead is
unnecessary in the scenario shown is Listing 10.10, in which there
cannot be more than one task waiting for the semaphore at any given
time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Listing 10.11 demonstrates how to avoid these drawbacks by using a task
notification in place of a binary semaphore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note: If a library uses task notifications, then the library's
documentation must clearly state that calling a library function can
change the calling task's notification state and notification value.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Listing 10.11:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>xTxSemaphore</code> member of the <code>xUART</code> structure has been replaced by
the <code>xTaskToNotify</code> member. <code>xTaskToNotify</code> is a variable of type
<code>TaskHandle_t</code>, and is used to hold the handle of the task that is
waiting for the UART operation to complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle()</code> FreeRTOS API function is used to
obtain the handle of the task that is in the Running state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The library does not create any FreeRTOS objects, so it does not incur
a RAM overhead, and does not need to be explicitly initialized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task notification is sent directly to the task that is waiting
for the UART operation to complete, so no unnecessary logic is
executed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>xTaskToNotify</code> member of the <code>xUART</code> structure is accessed from both a
task and an interrupt service routine, requiring that consideration be
given as to how the processor will update its value:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <code>xTaskToNotify</code> is updated by a single memory write operation, then
it can be updated outside of a critical section, exactly as shown in
Listing 10.11. This would be the case if <code>xTaskToNotify</code> is a 32-bit
variable (<code>TaskHandle_t</code> was a 32-bit type), and the processor on
which FreeRTOS is running is a 32-bit processor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If more than one memory write operation is required to update
<code>xTaskToNotify</code>, then <code>xTaskToNotify</code> must only be updated from within a
critical sectionâ€”otherwise the interrupt service routine might
access <code>xTaskToNotify</code> while it is in an inconsistent state. This
would be the case if <code>xTaskToNotify</code> is a 32-bit variable, and the
processor on which FreeRTOS is running is a 16-bit processor, as it
would require two 16-bit memory write operations to update all
32-bits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, <code>TaskHandle_t</code> is a
pointer, so <code>sizeof( TaskHandle_t )</code> always equals <code>sizeof( void * )</code>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Listing 10.11</strong></em> <em>Pseudo code demonstrating how a task notification can be used in a driver library transmit function</em></p>
<p>Task notifications can also replace semaphores in receive functions, as
demonstrated in pseudo code Listing 10.12, which provides the outline of
an RTOS aware library function that receives data on a UART port.
Referring to Listing 10.12:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>xUART_Receive()</code> function does not include any mutual exclusion
logic. If more than one task is going to use the <code>xUART_Receive()</code>
function, then the application writer will have to manage mutual
exclusion within the application itself. For example, a task may be
required to obtain a mutex before calling <code>xUART_Receive()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UART's receive interrupt service routine places the characters
that are received by the UART into a RAM buffer. The <code>xUART_Receive()</code>
function returns characters from the RAM buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>xUART_Receive()</code> <code>uxWantedBytes</code> parameter is used to specify the
number of characters to receive. If the RAM buffer does not already
contain the requested number characters, then the calling task is
placed into the Blocked state to wait to be notified that the number
of characters in the buffer has increased. The <code>while()</code> loop is used
to repeat this sequence until either the receive buffer contains the
requested number of characters, or a timeout occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The calling task may enter the Blocked state more than once. The
block time is therefore adjusted to take into account the amount of
time that has already passed since <code>xUART_Receive()</code> was called. The
adjustments ensure the total time spent inside <code>xUART_Receive()</code> does
not exceed the block time specified by the <code>xRxTimeout</code> member of the
<code>xUART</code> structure. The block time is adjusted using the FreeRTOS
<code>vTaskSetTimeOutState()</code> and <code>xTaskCheckForTimeOut()</code> helper functions.</p>

<p>The previous section demonstrated how to use <code>vTaskNotifyGiveFromISR()</code> to
send a task notification from an interrupt to a task.
<code>vTaskNotifyGiveFromISR()</code> is a simple function to use, but its
capabilities are limited; it can only send a task notification as a
valueless event, it cannot send data. This section demonstrates how to
use <code>xTaskNotifyFromISR()</code> to send data with a task notification event.
The technique is demonstrated by the pseudo code shown in Listing 10.13,
which provides the outline of an RTOS aware interrupt service routine
for an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). In Listing 10.13:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is assumed an ADC conversion is started at least every 50
milliseconds.</p>

the ADC. It is assumed the task's handle was stored in

conversion into the task's notification value.</p>
</li>

that a new ADC value is available, and to retrieve the result of the

<p>This section reinforces the power of task notifications by demonstrating
their use in a hypothetical application that includes the following
functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The application communicates across a slow internet connection to
send data to, and request data from, a remote data server. From here
on, the remote data server is referred to as the <em>cloud server</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After requesting data from the cloud server, the requesting task
must wait in the Blocked state for the requested data to be
received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After sending data to the cloud server, the sending task must wait
in the Blocked state for an acknowledgement that the cloud server
received the data correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A schematic of the software design is shown in Figure 10.6. In Figure 10.6:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The complexity of handling multiple internet connections to the
cloud server is encapsulated within a single FreeRTOS task. The task
acts as a proxy server within the FreeRTOS application, and is
referred to as the <em>server task</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application tasks read data from the cloud server by calling
<code>CloudRead()</code>. <code>CloudRead()</code> does not communicate with the cloud server
directly, but instead sends the read request to the server task on a
queue, and receives the requested data from the server task as a
task notification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application tasks write date to the cloud server by calling
<code>CloudWrite()</code>. <code>CloudWrite()</code> does not communicate with the cloud
server directly, but instead sends the write request to the server
task on a queue, and receives the result of the write operation from
the server task as a task notification.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The structure sent to the server task by the <code>CloudRead()</code> and
